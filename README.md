Caf√©s are becoming more popular among coffee lovers.
To improve and sustain this kind of drink, we need a system or program to manage a large amount of information and distribute products to each retailer. Furthermore, we'll broaden the scope of the shop system throughout the country.
This is why we're undertaking this endeavor. We build with the .NET framework and Winform platform.
A simple interface with many options and features for managing or providing customer assistance for a huge system. We hope that the project will expand in the future as more people or businesses use it.
